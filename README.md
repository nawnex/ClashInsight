# about üëÄ

Clash insight is a site about finding and learning from stats about any players or clans in Clash of Clans.
Most data is viewed when specifally looking up a unique player or clan.
i.e if I wanted to see clan stats I would look up my own clan name: HowlDuty
The search bar could then auto suggest the closest named clan, Linking the user to the clan page displaying all the clan stats featured.
The information that you can expect to find are current levels, trophies, clan members, war attack details, player ratings, and other stats that you would expect to find in Clash of Clans.


# My reasons for creating a Clash of Clans stat tracking website üñê
The justification for my site's existance harbors back to my desire to be able to track my clanmembers activity rates and war participation engagement.
Unfortunately it seemed that keeping track of war participation tracking was largely done manually with pen and paper.

Seeing the lack of the information and stats that I knew were possible to gather from the Clash of Clans api system but were missing from other similar sites available I decided to try to learn how to create a product that I would be able to use to quickly and easily to find the stats that mattered to me automatically upon just visiting my solution.

# The ballonoing features becoming available ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Originally my intention was just to have very breif and short features that simply were the minimum required to be expected from just utilizing CoC's Api purely to compare ClanMembers activity engagement.
This included Only functioning for clans and not player stats.

The resulting Website would then have the clans name minimal trophy stats and member count.
Making it faster and easier to visit scroll down to war results thus examinging your clan's last war and seeing which players choose to participate. 
If they participated... 
did they then choose to use both their attacks?
did they attack their mirror target?
If this information doesn't stack up well against their history wars then I would be vindicated in kicking them out.

The more I added the features the more I felt other stats were missing that could help corroborate your decision making.
Ok lets add a list of the clan members in the clan..
Ok well they got to be one click away from seeing their trophies, townhall, other levels and many more such stats..
Ok well you should need to be able to compare everybodies stats against eachother to rank them.... 
Ok but if im gathering all these stats for a clan page people might also be interested in a dedicated page to just player stats

After many bug fixes new statistics and most importantly learning stages.
Clash Insight now contains a multitude of variable stats and data that one would expect to find whilst also being impressed by what might not be expected

The next large leap would be to implement a database to carry many months of data for all to view and compare but due to costs such would require it wouldn't be expected unless theres a large jump in visitors

# Website Gallery üñº

One unique feature that no other site as of yet offers is the ability to show how far their progress on their base is in comparison to what the max levels offered by their Town hall.
